## Vision to the Blind

Our aim is to help the visually impaired get information regarding his surroundings and be able to find some object he wishes for.<br/>
In order to achieve this we perform video analysis of the personâ€™s surroundings. The person uses a phone to record the surrounding of which he needs a description or in which he needs to find a lost something. <br/>
Since the targeted audience are visually impaired, we make sure that the application is handy and user friendly by handling the input and giving out the feedback as audio signals.<br/>
In order to keep the application simple and efficient, we capture all the details of the surrounding by slicing the video to obtain unique frames, making sure we are not missing out any important details.<br/>
